# gravdark_specs
IDL procedures for generating gravity-darkened spectral energy distributions. See
individual procedures for details related to running the programs. 
Note that the entire Spectrsocopy Made Easy library for IDL is required to
run gen_smespecs.pro. You can get it here: https://www.stsci.edu/~valenti/sme.html.

Also be aware that I did not put a lot of effort into making these procedures
easily usable by the public so they are not thoroughly documented in some cases.
If you are interested in generating a gravity-darkened SED with this code, feel
free to reach out to me at pwcauley at gmail.com if you can't get it to work.
